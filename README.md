Autotyper

* Our college uses neocolab do assignments, you can't copy paste the answers normally, like in an online compiler like hackerrank.
* So I came up with a python script to type the contents present in a file.
* You can save the answer for a particular question in the text.txt file and run the script, switch focus to the website
* 3 seconds after running the script, it will start to automatically type the contents present in the file
* Since intendation is an issue in python, I have implemented language detection and leaving a tab space whereever intendation is present
* It also has autobracket removal (Have to improve this system later)
